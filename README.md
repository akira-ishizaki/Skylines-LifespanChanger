# Skylines-LifespanChanger
This changes cims' lifespan to a specified or more random age. This may reduce death waves. 
  
[Default] it is the same in vanilla. They die randomly from age 240. And it is not completely random.  
[More random age] They die randomly from age 180 (the age when they become seniors), but not completely randomly.  
[Very random age] They die completely randomly from age 180. You may feel unnatural that many cims live very long.  
[Maximum age] Almost people don't die until age 255. (It is their maximum age.)  
[Age when they become seniors] Almost people die at age 180. (It is the age when they become seniors.)   
  
They die only on aging. If they are moving at that time, they don't die.
